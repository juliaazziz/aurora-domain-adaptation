# Pre-trained models

This directory contains all pre-trained (and fine-tuned) models used in the paper.

There are two folders (`antarctica` and `falklands`) corresponding to both datasets. Within each one of these directories you will find two models:

-  `*_pretrained.keras`: the pretrained model before the domain-specific fine-tuning stage.
-  `*_finetuned.keras`: the final model after being fine-tuned on domain-specific data.
